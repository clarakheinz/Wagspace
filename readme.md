# Wagspace
### A parody social media profile page for the best boy.
---------------------------------------------------------
#### As a part of Code Louisville's Front End Development program, we are required to create a final project demonstrating the skills acquired during the 12 week course. I have chosen a simple but fun concept to run with, doesn't everyone miss MySpace? Well, what if our pets had something similar now?!

This site is hosted by GitHub Pages, to access the site please [click here](https://clarakheinz.github.io/Wagspace/).

As I build this website, I will update this README to include what skills I am demonstrating.

Skills demonstrated include:

1. Two media queries to adjust layout and content sizing for 2 different screen widths:
    * 1000px or greater screen width - Navigation becomes a row layout
    * 750px to 999px screen width - Main layout becomes 2 columns
2. Use of FlexBox to control layout changes
3. Navigation changes layout in response to screen widths
4. JavaScript function to dynamically insert HTML code:
    * Insert a random profile picture from a set of 4
    * Insert friend profile pictures
