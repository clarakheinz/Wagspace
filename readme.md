### A parody social media profile page for the best boy.
---------------------------------------------------------
#### As a part of Code Louisville's Front End Development program, we are required to create a final project demonstrating the skills acquired during the 12 week course. I have chosen a simple but fun concept to run with, a pseudo social media site for our pets! This demo is a profile page that shows a clean layout with buttons that provide simple functionality to interact with your friends.

This site is hosted by GitHub Pages, to access the site please [click here](https://clarakheinz.github.io/Wagspace/).

As I build this website, I will update this README to include what skills I am demonstrating.

Skills demonstrated include:

1. Two media queries to adjust layout and content sizing for 2 different screen widths:
    * 750px to 999px screen width - Main layout becomes 2 columns
    * 1000px or greater screen width - Navigation becomes a row layout
2. Use of FlexBox to control layout changes
    * The green action buttons swap order with the bio div in the column layout
3. Navigation changes layout in response to screen widths
    * Hamburger navigation for screens under 1000px in width 
    * Navigation become simple row style for large screens 1000px and above
4. JavaScript function to dynamically insert HTML code:
    * Insert a random profile picture from a set of 4
    * Insert friend profile pictures and names from array of JS objects
    * Insert featured pictures in Thor's pictures from array of objects with alt text
5. Javscript to show and hide HTML
    * When "Add Friend" or "Invite" buttons are clicked, JS functions show and hide different messages in a pop-up/modal window
    * When "Message" is clicked, JS function shows HTML form where Name, Email, and Message fields are validated
  

###Goals
Make this bad boy a full application. A web app coming soon.
